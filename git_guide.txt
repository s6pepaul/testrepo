To download Haspect and help improving it you need to set everything up first

1. Create account on github.com

2. Go to https://github.com/dglazier/HASPECT6 and click "Fork" (on the right hand side of the screen)

3. Go to https://github.com/[USERNAME]/HASPECT6 and click "Clone or download" and copy the link.

4. Open a terminal and cd into the directory you want the HASPECT code to be in

5. Type: git clone [LINK]
   Now you have the code and can start to use it and help developing it.


To keep your code up-to-date (do this regularly!). In your haspect directory type:

1. git remote add upstream https://github.com/dglazier/HASPECT6.git
   (This step only has to be done once)

2. git fetch upstream

3. git checkout master

4. git merge upstream/master


To make changes to the code:

1. Create a new branch where you want to apply the changes to by typing:
   git checkout master
   git branch [NEW BRANCH NAME]

2. Switch to branch
   git checkout [NEW BRANCH NAME]

3. Do some work

4. Check status by typing
   git status

5. Add the work you want to commit with
   git add [FILES]

6. Commit you work by typing
   git commit -m [meaningfull commit message, not just "commit1" etc]

7. Repeat 5. & 6. until there are no modified files

8. Push your changes to github with:
   git push origin [NEW BRANCH NAME]

9. Go to https://github.com/[USERNAME]/HASPECT6 and click on "Compare & pull request"

10. Select base (e.g. dglazier/HASPECT6 master) and make sure that the branches are "Able to merge"
    If there are conflicts resolve them or ask someone else to have a look

11. Click "Create pull request"

12. Wait for Derek to merge your code


General tips:
-Create a new branch for your work on the code and give it a meaningful name
-Use git status regularly to check the current status of your repository
-Regularly commit your work. If you break something you can easily restore everything then
-Files specified in .gitignore will not be looked after by git (e.g. .root files)
-If you want to try out everything first you can use https://github.com/s6pepaul/testrepo
 Feel free to add and change files as you like and create pull requests
